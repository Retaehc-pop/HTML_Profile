        <p>Since I was young, I always find myself solving countless puzzle. Solving problem and finding loophole to acquire the best solution of each puzzle. It has shaped my personality to be creative, questioning, and be a good thinker. Once I have been introduced to programming, I become addicted to it. Whenever I face an error in my code, I will find solution to each error and make it work. Every time I finished a program that can execute the given task, I feel like that problem I have is now solved. When my parent found out that I like programming, they fully support me as much as they can. I would like to take my opportunity and choose my major as Computer engineering science and pursue my dream career as a programmer.

            The moment I started to learn programming is when I was 13. My Senior taught me C for a couple times. But after he left for college, I must teach myself the rest. Being a self-studied programmer is quite challenging. To understand fundamental programming and start to think as a programmer didn’t take me long. Understanding algorithm and workflow is a requirement for coding, which I can do it effectively. It might be hard for some people to understand how this little machine work and processing each input/output, but for me it’s like going through a step-by-step tutorial to build a Lego. Even my pace of learning is short, but it is secure and reliable to be use in the future. Since I enjoy both programming and playing video games, I also want to try making my own as well.  Most of the programming language I learn is quite all around, I can program in Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Solidity, R, and Flutter. Although I start learning programming with C. My project frequently code with python. It is now my choice of language.

            In my high school, I am well known among teacher and friends. I like to do club’s activities. As a community volunteer service and academic activities. Since I have many club activities, time management is a principal skill. One of my Club is SPACE AC, Space Preparation Academic Cooperation and Engineering Assumption College. I oversee coding section and programming the microcontroller in order to execute each mission. This Club also participating in competition and publish research paper. This club has gathered student who share the same passion to be an engineer. Activities in this club teach me to be able to work under pressure and limited time. I have done a considerable number of projects with this club such as make a high-altitude balloon, develop a rocket, and improve a CanSat, a can shape satellite. My biggest accomplishment is competing in CanSat competition. This event is designed mainly for undergraduate student. The competition not only demand high engineering skill but also teamwork and creativity. My friends and I, Junior student, have form a team to compete in this 7-month long project and won third place in this competition. Since I have joined this club, I acquire knowledge for programming, data analyzing, and engineering. These beneficial skills can be used to upgrade my standard for each project as well. 
            I call myself as an Inquiring person. Thailand education system is not designed for questioning people like me. Many Thai student has suffered from unsupported education system. Since my birth, I have been studied in this system and I don’t think there is any university in Thailand that suit my learning personality. Therefore, Computer engineering science of RWTH Aachen university, which is one of the best universities that produce many talented programmers, can improve my skills to be in the top of computer engineering field. It is my goal to study there as an undergraduate level. Finally for my life goal, I want to create an innovation which helps people life easier and make this world a better place. But no matter how many times I failed; each failure is a process of success. I believe that one day I will be a part which make impact to this world.
